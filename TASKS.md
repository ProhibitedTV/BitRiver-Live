  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `setCSRFCookie` returns `(*http.Cookie, error)` and never silently emits empty CSRF tokens.
    - `csrfMiddleware` handles CSRF token generation failure by logging a warning and returning `403` for protected requests.
    - Existing exempt-path and bearer-token bypass behavior remains unchanged.

- [x] Task 2 — Add regression tests for token-generation failure denial
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Tests can force CSRF token generation failure deterministically.
    - Protected cookie-auth requests that require token issuance are denied with forbidden status when generation fails.
    - Downstream handler is not called on token-generation failure.

- [x] Task 3 — Run scoped server tests and record results
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `GOTOOLCHAIN=local GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off go test ./internal/server -count=1` passes.
    - Execution log for this scoped section is recorded.

## Scoped change: server runtime shutdown close warning logs

Status legend: `[ ]` not started, `[-]` in progress, `[x]` done

- [x] Task 1 — Replace ignored shutdown close errors with warning logs in `internal/app/server_runtime.go`
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Shutdown still attempts `store`, then `session_store`, then `mfa_store` close operations in existing order.
    - Close errors are logged as warnings with component identifiers: `store`, `session_store`, `mfa_store`.
    - Shutdown remains non-fatal (no early return introduced).

- [x] Task 2 — Add shutdown close-warning tests in `internal/app/server_runtime_test.go`
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Test uses fake closers returning errors for store/session/mfa.
    - Assertions verify warning logs include each component identifier and close error context.
    - Assertions verify shutdown continues and invokes all closers despite earlier close failures.

- [x] Task 3 — Run validation commands and record results
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `go test ./internal/app -count=1` passes.
    - `./scripts/verify.sh` passes (or explicit environment limitation captured).

### Execution log (server runtime shutdown close warning logs)
- ✅ Task 1 complete: replaced ignored shutdown close errors with warning logs carrying component identifiers for store, session_store, and mfa_store while preserving shutdown flow/order.
- ✅ Task 2 complete: added shutdown test with failing closers that asserts warning logs for each component and confirms shutdown continues through all closers in order.
- ✅ Task 2 check:
  - ✅ `go test ./internal/app -count=1`
- ✅ Task 3 checks:
  - ✅ `./scripts/verify.sh`
  - ⚠️ Docker-dependent checks skipped by verify script because docker is not installed in this environment.
- ✅ Task 3 re-check after gofmt:
  - ✅ `go test ./internal/app -count=1`

- [x] Task 2 — Use helper in handler/runtime wiring paths
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `internal/app/http.go` `NewHandler` uses helper for `handler.UploadSourceStorage` assignment.
    - `internal/app/server_runtime.go` upload processor config setup uses helper.
    - No behavior changes beyond mapping deduplication.

- [x] Task 3 — Add focused unit test for mapping fidelity

## Scoped change: unify creator live status labels

Status legend: `[ ]` not started, `[-]` in progress, `[x]` done

- [x] Task 1 — Add single-source creator status labels in creator live page
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `web/viewer/app/creator/live/[channelId]/page.tsx` defines a single shared mapping for creator-visible labels for offline/starting/live/error conditions.
    - `deriveControlCentreStatus(...)` reads labels from that mapping instead of hardcoded per-branch strings.

- [x] Task 2 — Reuse same labels in test panel status copy
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `testPanelStatus` in `page.tsx` reuses the shared label mapping.
    - Offline idle and degraded reconnecting states each use one consistent label across derive/test panel.
    - Instructions remain minimal and deterministic per status.

- [x] Task 3 — Update label assertions in viewer tests
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Tests under `web/viewer/__tests__` that assert `deriveControlCentreStatus` labels are updated for unified wording.
    - `cd web/viewer && npm run test -- creatorLiveStreamStatus.test.ts` passes.
- [x] Task 1 — Add single-source creator status labels in creator live page
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `web/viewer/app/creator/live/[channelId]/page.tsx` defines a single shared mapping for creator-visible labels for offline/starting/live/error conditions.
    - `deriveControlCentreStatus(...)` reads labels from that mapping instead of hardcoded per-branch strings.

- ✅ Task 1 complete: added `CREATOR_STATUS_LABELS` and switched `deriveControlCentreStatus`/default stream status labels to use the shared map.
- ✅ Task 1 check:
  - ✅ `cd web/viewer && npm run test -- creatorLiveStreamStatus.test.ts`

- [x] Task 2 — Reuse same labels in test panel status copy
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `testPanelStatus` in `page.tsx` reuses the shared label mapping.
    - Offline idle and degraded reconnecting states each use one consistent label across derive/test panel.
    - Instructions remain minimal and deterministic per status.

- ✅ Task 2 complete: updated `testPanelStatus` to reuse shared labels and simplified status instructions for offline/live/reconnecting/error states.
- ✅ Task 2 check:
  - ✅ `cd web/viewer && npm run test -- creatorLiveStreamStatus.test.ts`

- [x] Task 3 — Update label assertions in viewer tests
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Tests under `web/viewer/__tests__` that assert `deriveControlCentreStatus` labels are updated for unified wording.
    - `cd web/viewer && npm run test -- creatorLiveStreamStatus.test.ts` passes.

- ✅ Task 3 complete: updated `creatorLiveStreamStatus` label expectation from `Ingesting` to `Reconnecting`.
- ✅ Task 3 checks:
  - ✅ `cd web/viewer && npm run test -- creatorLiveStreamStatus.test.ts`
  - ✅ `./scripts/verify.sh` (full repo + viewer checks; passed with expected npm env warnings and docker skip notices)

## Scoped change: following summary label clarity and terminology consistency

Status legend: `[ ]` not started, `[-]` in progress, `[x]` done

- [x] Task 1 — Define and centralize following summary copy constants
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - `web/viewer/components/following/FollowingState.tsx` exports shared summary label constants for followed-count and live-now-count text.
    - Existing empty/unauthenticated copy remains centralized and unchanged in meaning.

- [x] Task 2 — Update FollowingSidebar and FollowingRail to use explicit summary labels
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Sidebar ready summary shows an explicit followed count label (e.g. `X followed`).
    - Rail ready summary shows an explicit live-now count label (e.g. `X live now`).
    - Both components consume shared copy constants from `FollowingState.tsx` where applicable.

- [x] Task 3 — Update/verify viewer tests for terminology and summary semantics
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Tests cover new explicit summary labels for sidebar/rail ready states.
    - Empty/unauthenticated wording remains consistent across both surfaces.
    - `cd web/viewer && npm run test -- followingStatePresentation.test.tsx followingSidebar.test.tsx` passes and results are logged below.

### Execution log (following summary label clarity and terminology consistency)
- ✅ Task 1 complete: added shared summary label builders in `FOLLOWING_COPY` for followed-count and live-now-count phrasing.
- ✅ Task 1 check:
  - ✅ `cd web/viewer && npm run test -- followingStatePresentation.test.tsx`
- ✅ Task 2 complete: sidebar now reports explicit followed totals and rail now reports explicit live-now totals, both sourced from shared following copy constants.
- ⚠️ Task 2 check (intermediate):
  - ❌ `cd web/viewer && npm run test -- followingStatePresentation.test.tsx followingSidebar.test.tsx` (failed due to pre-existing single-match assertion in `followingSidebar.test.tsx` after summary copy became intentionally duplicated in empty state UI)
- ✅ Task 3 complete: updated viewer tests to assert explicit summary semantics and consistent channels-focused terminology across rail/sidebar.
- ✅ Task 3 checks:
  - ✅ `cd web/viewer && npm run test -- followingStatePresentation.test.tsx followingSidebar.test.tsx`
  - ✅ `./scripts/verify.sh`
