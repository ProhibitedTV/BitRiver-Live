# BitRiver Live v1.0.0 release notes

BitRiver Live v1.0.0 marks the project's first production-ready release. It
delivers a complete self-hostable streaming stack that combines Go services,
Next.js viewer tooling, ingest and transcoding pipelines, and deployment assets.

## Highlights

- **Operations-ready backend** – `cmd/server` exposes the admin SPA, public API,
  chat, analytics, and OAuth flows, while the release workflow builds
  cross-platform binaries with the migrations and deploy assets bundled for
  operators.
- **Full ingest pipeline** – Docker Compose configurations under `deploy/`
  provision SRS for RTMP ingest, OvenMediaEngine for HLS/DASH playback, and the
  FFmpeg-based transcoder controller so creators can stream end-to-end out of the
  box.
- **Production viewer** – `web/viewer` ships as a standalone Next.js bundle
  linted, tested, and built during the release workflow before being published as
  an artefact.
- **Stateful storage choices** – Postgres-backed persistence is the default, with
  Redis for chat fan-out and throttling plus a JSON datastore option for demos.
- **Hardening and validation** – The release pipeline gates Go unit tests,
  Postgres storage tests, and viewer lint/integration checks before publishing.

## Upgrade guidance

1. Review the [production release runbook](../production-release.md) for the
   checklist covering tests, tagging, credential rotation, and smoke checks.
2. Follow the [advanced deployment guide](../advanced-deployments.md) to confirm
   ingest, transcoder, object storage, and retention settings line up with your
   infrastructure.
3. Refresh environment files from `deploy/.env.example`, run `deploy/check-env.sh`
   to validate secrets, and update container tags to `v1.0.0`.
4. After upgrading, stream a channel end-to-end and verify recordings land in the
   configured object storage bucket.

## Verification

The release artifacts were built by [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml)
after completing the following gates:

- `go test ./... -count=1 -timeout=120s`
- `./scripts/test-postgres.sh`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test:integration`

Refer to the workflow run attached to the GitHub Release tag for logs and
artefacts.
